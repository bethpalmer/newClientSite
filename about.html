                        <h3 class="orange">Hi, I'm Beth...</h3>
                        <p>I'm a Brighton based freelance website designer. I'm passionate about great web design and I'm committed to my own continued learning in the areas of marketing strategy, user experience and digital communication and analysis.</p>
                        <p>Creative by nature, design is something I have been practicing throughout my life, working on regular passion projects. My love of web design in particular was honed in an IT support role in which I lead a team of web developers in creating a £150k web application from concept through to launch and post-launch support.</p>
                        <p>On successful completion of the project I undertook formal web design training - a front-end development nanodegree - with reputable online training platform Udacity. Since then I have been applying my skills to help individuals and SMEs by developing beautiful websites tailored to meet their specific business needs.</p>
                        <p>My talent lies in understanding what you want to get across and translating that into powerful content, with layout and presentation designed to guide your users to  undertake predetermined actions, increasing user engagement and customer conversion rates for my clients.</p>
                        <a type="button" href="mailto:bethpalmerdesigns@gmail.com" class="btn btn-custom text-uppercase">Got a project in mind?<br>Get in touch</a>
                        <div id="process"></div>
                        <h3 class="orange">How I work</h3>
                        <p>I work very much on a case by case basis. Some sites are 100% bespoke whilst others might be customised from a template depending on budget and requirements. I'm happy to include a CMS for clients where needed, either WordPress or an appropriate alternative.</p>
                        <p>I find it's important to spend time getting to know you and your business, understanding your business goals, and getting clear on your particular USPs to be sure all the marketing essentials are being included in the content.</p>
                        <p>Another key element in successful design is to really know the market, to be aware of any design trends, to discover what works and where you can deviate from the norm to create a product which really stands out.</p>
                        <p>Together we will agree the broad spectrum content, layout, and an idea of visuals or theme where necessary. As a keen copywriter I am likely to recommend content edits and formatting in line with proven marketing principles and effective layout. For me, it's important to build professional relationships in which we are both comfortable to challenge the other so that together we create the best possible product for your customers.</p>
                        <p>Once the product has been developed, a single round of feedback should enable us to finalise a product which is beautifully effective in achieving its goals.</p>
                        <p>I am able to fully manage your hosting and email continuity minimising any hassle and worry to you about your online services. I also provide maintenance contracts at a level which is suitable for your business for ongoing support and priority regular updates as desired.</p>
                        <p>I can also fully manage your hosting, email continuity, and provide maintenance contracts at a level that is appropriate for your business for ongoing support and updates as required.</p>
                        <p>Projects normally total from around £500 upwards depending on the requirements. I ask for 25% of the payment upfront, and the rest either in instalments (depending on the length of the project) or on completion, prior to facilitating hosting for the site.</p>
